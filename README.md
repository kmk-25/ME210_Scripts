# Stanford ME210 Final Project Codebase

This is code developed in collaboration with Pierre Labroche. It drives a robot built for the Stanford class ME210.
### Scripts:

- IR_Test: Calibration sensing for the IR sensors used for line following
- Motor_Test: When a button is pressed, it moves the motors forward until the robot hits a wall, then backs up. Used to calibrate speed and motor direction
- Servo_Test: Used to calibrate the servo motor for the push button
- Linefollow_Test: Line following algorithm
